00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,599
Hi Bob the Canadian here. Let's learn English around the house. Come on in.

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:24,960
Hi Bob the Canadian here. Welcome to this video. If this is your first time here, don't forget

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,320
to click the subscribe button below and give me a thumbs up at some point during this video

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,640
if it's helping you learn English. Well today we're going to learn some English words and phrases

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,840
that you can use to describe a house. I just came in through the front door.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,480
Houses generally have a front door and a back door. I'll show you that one a bit later. And I'm

7
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:56,479
standing in the front entrance or the entrance way of the house. It's a little warm so I'm going to

8
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:03,119
take off my coat and you'll notice behind me there's a coat hanger. So I'm going to hang my coat

9
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:11,519
here and I'm going to do what we traditionally do in Canada and that is that I'm going to take off my shoes.

10
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,239
Before we go any further though, I want to thank Barb the Canadian for letting me use her

11
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:24,399
house today to make this video to help you learn English. The front entrance way also usually has

12
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:31,359
a closet where you can hang coats and other items. So especially in the winter when you come into

13
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:37,759
a home you might want to hang your coat in the closet if there's not enough room on the coat hangers.

14
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,679
So you'll notice behind me here the kitchen. The kitchen is one of my favorite rooms in the house.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,720
I really like food so I really like kitchens. You'll notice behind me here that a kitchen has a

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,800
certain number of items we have the refrigerator or the fridge where you can keep food cold. This

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,160
fridge has a freezer on the bottom. We also have the stove and generally we call this part

18
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,159
the oven where you would bake things. And here we have the stove where you would cook things.

19
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:17,439
If you look behind me here you'll see we have a sink. So when you're all done, making your food and

20
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:23,120
eating your food you can do the dishes. You can wash the dishes in the sink. And if you look over here

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,240
on the counter you'll notice that we have three things that you find quite often in a kitchen.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,000
We have a coffee maker. We have a kettle for boiling water and we have a pitcher of water if you

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,280
just want to drink some water. Up here you'll notice that we have cupboards. So cupboards notice

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,960
it's not pronounced the way it looks. In a cupboard you'll find things like plates and bowls

25
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:57,199
that you can use for eating. Those are pretty loud. And if we look over here we'll have what we

26
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:07,280
in Canada would call a utensil drawer. So this is a drawer where you would keep spoons for and knives.

27
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:16,560
You'll also see this area here is what we would call the counter or the counter top. You can use

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,519
both words interchangeably. So you might use the counter top or the counter to prepare food.

29
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,000
And you'll notice hiding over here in the corner we have a microwave just a small appliance

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,520
that lets you heat up food really, really quickly. So that's the kitchen. One of my favorite rooms.

31
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,920
Let's move on to the living room. So we're in the living room now. The living room is the room in the

32
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:50,480
home where you will usually find chairs and sofas or what we also call couches. It's the room where

33
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,120
when you just want to relax. This is the room that you would generally sit in. Maybe you want to read a

34
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,879
book. Maybe you want to watch TV. If we look over here you'll see that this living room also has a TV

35
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,319
a television where you could sit just to have a quiet relaxing evening where you are going to

36
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,879
entertain yourself by reading a book. Maybe sitting and talking with friends or watching some television.

37
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:26,560
So that's a living room. Let's look at the dining room next. Another part of the house that I really

38
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,399
like is the dining room. So this is a room with a table specifically for eating meals. So you would have

39
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:42,079
breakfast, lunch and supper at this table in the dining room. You can tell that Christmas is coming soon.

40
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll do a video soon about Christmas. I think next week I'm going to a parade and I'll show you

41
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:55,120
a whole bunch of stuff about Christmas. But this is the dining room. We have a dining room table and we have

42
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,720
chairs to sit at as we would eat our meals. So we're in the bathroom now and there's really

43
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,680
three main parts to a bathroom. We have a sink where you could wash your hands so you could turn

44
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,160
on the water and wash your hands. We also have if I turn just a little bit behind me here we have

45
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,760
shower so you could jump in here to have a shower. Maybe at the end of a long day of work.

46
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,280
And then we also have and I'm not going to describe what this is for. But we also have a toilet.

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,440
I think everyone in the world knows what this is for and how to use it. So I'm not going to spend

48
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,800
any time describing it but you have a toilet. This is the toilet seat. You have toilet paper.

49
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,760
And this is where you would go. If you felt the call of nature, that's the nice way of putting it.

50
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,040
So we're in the upstairs of the house now. You'll notice that we're in a bedroom. So there's a

51
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,960
good reason why it's called a bedroom. It's because there's a bed. So in a bedroom you're going to

52
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,480
have a bed. Here also going to have things that in English we call dressers. So if you look over here

53
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,879
there is a dresser and a dresser is a place where using these drawers. This is where you would

54
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:18,639
store all of your clothes. So in a bedroom you generally have a bed just right here and you have

55
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,120
a dresser where you can store stuff. There's also in this bedroom what we would call night tables.

56
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,360
So there's a table on each side of the bed with a small lamp. This is a place where you could keep a

57
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,600
book if you read at night before you go to bed. You would keep it on your night stand or night

58
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,680
table. So this is a bedroom. I'm not sure how easy this is to see but I'm standing in a hallway.

59
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:53,520
So a hallway is the part of the home that connects all the rooms together. This room is empty.

60
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,680
In English we would call this a spare room. Sometimes a spare room has an extra bed in it. This

61
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:08,480
room is just empty. So we would call this a spare room. I just came down these stairs and I'm now

62
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:17,920
in the basement of this house. A basement is the part of the house that is below ground and many

63
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,759
times in a home the basement is used to store things. It also usually has a furnace. This is what

64
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:33,279
heats the home with gas or oil in the winter and a hot water heater. This is what makes hot water

65
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,719
for the house as well. And usually those types of things are found in a basement. So we're here in the

66
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:43,759
basement. It's the part that's below ground. I'll just show you a window over here for a sec so that you

67
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,120
get a sense of where we are. So here's the basement window. It's a little hard to see. But if you look

68
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:59,680
outside you'll notice that we are at ground level or below ground level in the basement here.

69
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,800
So a lot of Canadian homes will also have a garage. A garage is a place where you can keep your car

70
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:19,439
and a garage has a garage door which you just saw open behind me as well. A garage sometimes has

71
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,879
a garage door opener. This is a device that's on the ceiling of the garage. I'll just show you

72
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,600
for a sec. This is a device that's on the ceiling of a garage that opens the door automatically

73
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:42,320
when you click the button in your car. So that's a garage door opener. It's a little cold to be out

74
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,240
here with no coat on but I just wanted to show you earlier I mentioned the back door. This is the

75
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,320
back door of the house. When you have a back door a lot of times you'll have a barbecue outside

76
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:01,440
and then also down here there's just kind of a patio area. So there's an area where you can come out

77
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,680
to cook some food in the summer months when it's warmer. You can come out your back door. You can

78
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,480
go down your steps and you can use your barbecue to cook some food. So this is a small patio area

79
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,159
outside the back door. Well hey thanks for joining me today to learn some English that you can use
