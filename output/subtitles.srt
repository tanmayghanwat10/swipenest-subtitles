6.00 --> 8.00
Hi, Bob the Canadian here.

2
8.00 --> 10.44
Let's learn English around the house.

3
10.44 --> 11.96
Come on in.

4
11.96 --> 21.34
Hi, Bob the Canadian here.

5
21.34 --> 22.50
Welcome to this video.

6
22.50 --> 27.42
If this is your first time here, don't forget to click the subscribe button below and

7
27.42 --> 32.46
give me a thumbs up at some point during this video if it's helping you learn English.

8
32.46 --> 38.06
Well today, we're going to learn some English words and phrases that you can use

9
38.06 --> 39.86
to describe a house.

10
39.86 --> 42.42
I just came in through the front door.

11
42.42 --> 46.02
I just generally have a front door and a back door.

12
46.02 --> 48.34
I'll show you that one a bit later.

13
48.34 --> 54.98
And I'm standing in the front entrance or the entrance way of the house.

14
54.98 --> 58.30
It's a little warm, so I'm going to take off my coat.

15
58.30 --> 61.90
And you'll notice behind me there's a coat hanger.

16
61.90 --> 66.78
So I'm going to hang my coat here and I'm going to do what we traditionally

17
66.78 --> 73.22
do in Canada and that is that I'm going to take off my shoes.

18
73.22 --> 77.80
Before we go any further though, I want to thank Barb the Canadian for letting

19
77.80 --> 81.86
me use her house today to make this video to help you learn English.

20
81.86 --> 87.66
The front entrance way also usually has a closet where you can hang coats and other

21
87.66 --> 89.06
items.

22
89.06 --> 93.54
So especially in the winter when you come into a home, you might want to hang your

23
93.54 --> 98.04
coat in the closet if there's not enough room on the coat hangers.

24
98.04 --> 100.38
So you'll notice behind me here the kitchen.

25
100.38 --> 103.90
The kitchen is one of my favourite rooms in the house.

26
103.90 --> 107.50
I really like food, so I really like kitchens.

27
107.50 --> 112.56
You'll notice behind me here that a kitchen has a certain number of items.

28
112.56 --> 116.82
We have the refrigerator or the fridge where you can keep food cold.

29
116.82 --> 120.10
This fridge has a freezer on the bottom.

30
120.10 --> 126.38
We also have the stove and generally we call this part the oven where you would

31
126.38 --> 127.38
bake things.

32
127.38 --> 130.90
And up here we have the stove where you would cook things.

33
130.90 --> 134.58
If you look behind me here, you'll see we have a sink.

34
134.58 --> 139.26
So when you're all done making your food and eating your food, you can do the

35
139.26 --> 140.26
dishes.

36
140.26 --> 142.50
You can wash the dishes in the sink.

37
142.50 --> 146.28
And if you look over here on the counter, you'll notice that we have three things

38
146.28 --> 148.48
that you find quite often in the kitchen.

39
148.48 --> 153.48
We have a coffee maker, we have a kettle for boiling water, and we have a pitcher of

40
153.48 --> 155.92
water if you just want to drink some water.

41
155.92 --> 159.80
Up here you'll notice that we have cupboards.

42
159.80 --> 163.68
So cupboards, notice it's not pronounced the way it looks.

43
163.68 --> 172.88
In a cupboard you'll find things like plates and bowls that you can use for eating.

44
172.88 --> 174.18
Those are pretty loud.

45
174.18 --> 181.48
And if we look over here, we'll have what we in Canada would call a utensil drawer.

46
181.48 --> 188.50
So this is a drawer where you would keep spoons, forks, and knives.

47
188.50 --> 196.10
You'll also see this area here is what we would call the counter or the countertop.

48
196.10 --> 199.30
You can use both words interchangeably.

49
199.30 --> 204.06
So you might use the countertop or the counter to prepare food.

50
204.06 --> 210.16
And you'll notice hiding over here in the corner we have a microwave, just a small appliance

51
210.16 --> 212.82
that lets you heat up food really, really quickly.

52
212.82 --> 215.94
So that's the kitchen, one of my favorite rooms.

53
215.94 --> 218.62
Let's move on to the living room.

54
218.62 --> 220.30
So we're in the living room now.

55
220.30 --> 225.60
The living room is the room in the home where you will usually find chairs and

56
225.60 --> 229.38
sofas or what we also call couches.

57
229.38 --> 233.22
It's the room where when you just want to relax.

58
233.22 --> 236.36
This is the room that you would generally sit in.

59
236.36 --> 238.18
Maybe you want to read a book.

60
238.18 --> 240.34
Maybe you want to watch TV.

61
240.34 --> 246.70
If we look over here, you'll see that this living room also has a TV, a television

62
246.70 --> 252.22
where you could sit just to have a quiet, relaxing evening where you are going to

63
252.22 --> 257.58
entertain yourself by reading a book, maybe sitting and talking with friends or

64
257.58 --> 259.02
watching some television.

65
259.02 --> 260.82
So that's the living room.

66
260.82 --> 263.66
Let's look at the dining room next.

67
263.66 --> 269.22
So another part of the house that I really like is the dining room.

68
269.22 --> 273.94
So this is a room with a table specifically for eating meals.

69
273.94 --> 278.98
So you would have breakfast, lunch and supper at this table in the dining room.

70
278.98 --> 282.26
You can tell that Christmas is coming soon.

71
282.26 --> 285.38
I'll do a video soon about Christmas.

72
285.38 --> 289.14
I think next week I'm going to a parade and I'll show you a whole bunch of stuff

73
289.14 --> 290.14
about Christmas.

74
290.14 --> 291.88
This is the dining room.

75
291.88 --> 298.62
We have a dining room table and we have chairs to sit at as we would eat our meals.

76
298.62 --> 303.70
So we're in the bathroom now and there's really three main parts to a bathroom.

77
303.70 --> 307.02
We have a sink where you could wash your hands.

78
307.02 --> 309.74
So you could turn on the water and wash your hands.

79
309.74 --> 315.36
We also have, if I turn just a little bit behind me here, we have a shower.

80
315.36 --> 319.98
So you could jump in here to have a shower, maybe at the end of a long day of work.

81
319.98 --> 324.34
And then we also have, and I'm not going to describe what this is for, but we also

82
324.34 --> 326.10
have a toilet.

83
326.10 --> 330.34
I think everyone in the world knows what this is for and how to use it.

84
330.34 --> 334.46
So I'm not going to spend any time describing it, but you have a toilet.

85
334.46 --> 335.90
This is the toilet seat.

86
335.90 --> 342.66
You have toilet paper and this is where you would go if you felt the call of nature.

87
342.66 --> 344.30
That's the nice way of putting it.

88
344.30 --> 346.26
So we're in the upstairs of the house now.

89
346.26 --> 348.72
You'll notice that we're in a bedroom.

90
348.72 --> 351.36
So there's a good reason why it's called a bedroom.

91
351.36 --> 353.90
It's because there's a bed.

92
353.90 --> 356.08
So in a bedroom, you're going to have a bed.

93
356.08 --> 361.40
You're also going to have things that in English we call dressers.

94
361.40 --> 368.56
So if you look over here, there is a dresser and a dresser is a place where using these

95
368.56 --> 373.68
drawers, this is where you would store all of your clothes.

96
373.68 --> 379.24
So in a bedroom, you generally have a bed, which is right here, and you have a dresser

97
379.24 --> 380.72
where you can store stuff.

98
380.72 --> 385.28
There's also in this bedroom, what we would call night tables.

99
385.28 --> 389.00
So there's a table on each side of the bed with a small lamp.

100
389.00 --> 392.32
This is a place where you could keep a book.

101
392.32 --> 396.92
If you read at night before you go to bed, you would keep it on your nightstand

102
396.92 --> 398.78
or night table.

103
398.78 --> 399.78
So this is a bedroom.

104
400.38 --> 406.18
I'm not sure how easy this is to see, but I'm standing in a hallway.

105
406.18 --> 412.34
So a hallway is the part of the home that connects all the rooms together.

106
412.34 --> 414.70
This room is empty.

107
414.70 --> 418.34
In English, we would call this a spare room.

108
418.34 --> 421.62
Sometimes a spare room has an extra bed in it.

109
421.62 --> 423.86
This room is just empty.

110
423.86 --> 426.02
So we would call this a spare room.

111
426.02 --> 431.54
I just came down these stairs, and I'm now in the basement of this house.

112
431.54 --> 439.46
A basement is the part of the house that is below ground, and many times in a home

113
439.46 --> 442.66
the basement is used to store things.

114
442.66 --> 445.34
It also usually has a furnace.

115
445.34 --> 451.54
This is what heats the home with gas or oil in the winter, and a hot water heater.

116
451.54 --> 454.94
This is what makes hot water for the house as well.

117
454.94 --> 458.14
And usually those types of things are found in a basement.

118
458.14 --> 461.26
So here in the basement, it's the part that's below ground.

119
461.26 --> 465.58
I'll just show you a window over here for a second so that you get a sense of where

120
465.58 --> 466.58
we are.

121
466.58 --> 468.10
So here's the basement window.

122
468.10 --> 470.62
It's a little hard to see.

123
470.62 --> 477.38
But if you look outside, you'll notice that we are at ground level or below ground

124
477.38 --> 484.54
level in the basement here.

125
484.54 --> 488.02
So a lot of Canadian homes will also have a garage.

126
488.02 --> 491.70
A garage is a place where you can keep your car.

127
491.70 --> 497.18
And a garage has a garage door, which you just saw open behind me.

128
497.18 --> 502.38
As well, a garage sometimes has a garage door opener.

129
502.38 --> 506.96
This is a device that's on the ceiling of the garage, and I'll just show you

130
506.96 --> 507.96
for a second.

131
507.96 --> 513.68
This is a device that's on the ceiling of a garage that opens the door automatically

132
513.92 --> 518.66
when you click the button in your car.

133
518.66 --> 520.16
So that's a garage door opener.

134
520.16 --> 526.20
It's a little cold to be out here with no coat on, but I just wanted to show you

135
526.20 --> 528.00
earlier I mentioned the back door.

136
528.00 --> 530.76
This is the back door of the house.

137
530.76 --> 535.20
When you have a back door, a lot of times you'll have a barbecue outside.

138
535.20 --> 539.80
And then also down here, there's just kind of a patio area.

139
539.80 --> 543.28
So there's an area where you can come out to cook some food in the summer months

140
543.28 --> 544.44
when it's warmer.

141
544.44 --> 545.72
You can come out your back door.

142
545.72 --> 549.88
You can go down your steps and you can use your barbecue to cook some food.

143
549.88 --> 553.80
So this is a small patio area outside the back door.

144
553.80 --> 558.48
Well, hey, thanks for joining me today to learn some English that you can use

145
558.48 --> 559.56
