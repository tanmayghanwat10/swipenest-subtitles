1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:06,319
The English language is a peaceful city and the people here are just lovely,

4
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:20,000
I think they are secure here.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It is very calm and it is quite like it is lovely, it is very peaceful.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
From all over the world, compared to learning, which also has to do degrees.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There are a lot of English students because of Cambridge University, but also a lot of international students.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So there is quite a good life for young people.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My name is Cristina, I'm from Belgium and I'm 18 years old, so I just finished high school in June.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was quite confused about what I wanted to study this year.

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So I decided to do one year program, which is the foundation program, but also to improve my English,

12
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because when I came here, it was not that good.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My name is Michaela Shbert, I'm from Czech Republic.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I spent here a year affecting my English and to be honest, really figuring out what I want to do with my life.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And then I met my English boyfriend, decided to release tea and do all the things I wanted to do here.

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I started the university, I wanted to do what I want to do, so I'm sending a film and media here in Cambridge.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
My name is Carolina Blay and I'm from Venezuela.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And basically I'm doing a foundation course and it's just sort of here in the UK.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My parents told me I would like to go to a different country and learn English.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I said, yeah, why not? They told me, why don't you go to Canada or America because it's quite near to Venezuela and I say,

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I would like to go with England. Really? Yeah, I would like to go to Cambridge.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't know why, you know, it was like a feeling that I wanted to go there.

23
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Then when we were like to sign if it was better to say in a home stay or in a residence, I say,

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think I would like to say in a home stay, so I would practice with my horse mom and my horse dad and you know, meet a really real family and how they live and everything.

25
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And I think I made the right choice.

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My name is Sylvia and I'm from Italy and we are in Cambridge now in I'm a home stay girl.

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And here in this house is my first time but I went to Cambridge twice a year ago for the same reason starting at school and home stay after.

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes, it's very good.

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And,

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And,

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And,

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
means now,

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:37,000
they give us everything for the accommodation, laundry, everything and the conversation that is most important part of our, of this own stay.

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And, is very nice.

35
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I mean, is the right thing to do to learn language for me.

36
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, home stay is basically a language in coming to live with a British family, be integrated into the family and immerse themselves in English to help them learn.

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The basic home stay booking would be on a half-board basis, which is bed breakfast and evening meal.

38
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And the student would expect, obviously, their own room and less specified in which case they make share with a friend in a twin room,

39
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
basis.

40
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But they would expect, obviously, a bed wardrobe, a desk, lighting, so much to work.

41
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Other extras may be into the access via Wi-Fi.

42
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They would have access to laundry facilities and cooking facilities if they are booking on a self-catering basis.

43
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, in my home stay, I had dinner with them every day at 6, and also with a different students that are in houses,

44
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and every Thursday they wash my clothes and they clean my room.

45
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And, actually, because I've been in my home stay for a year and a half, I play squash with my house mom every Sunday and we enjoy different activities together.

46
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've been in the birthday of the kids and everything, so it's no one really remember of the family.

47
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, home stay is where you stay with an English family.

48
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And when I send English family encompasses all different nationalities of become part of English life.

49
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And then you usually spend the morning at school at the afternoon free.

50
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And then in the evening there's always a meal ready for you.

51
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And we all sit at the table, talk about what you've done during the day, perhaps discuss different aspects of English life.

52
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Hello, I would like to take my eyes, where I don't know when our next available date.

53
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, okay, let's know from them.

54
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Here's a list of the next available pilot states in Cambridge.

55
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
For example, I think the next one is April the day.

56
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I knew actually people who came here before to do the same program as me.

57
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And one of them told me about her home stay that was really good and she enjoyed a lot.

58
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So she recommended to me and the best cool also recommended this some good home stays.

59
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And so I chose to go in the one I'm here now because I knew how it would happen more or less and also because we had a kitchen for

60
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the students we had quite good things in this specific family.

61
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Often I understand that students have known previous students who've been in our house.

62
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And so they apparently, when they send an application in or first met in a garage at the Bell School, they say it does, it's got a habit room.

63
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And then the Bell School, what phone me, I have asked if I have a room for giving the dates and it goes from there.

64
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, then you said can you tell Jo that's one of the things that's going to eat home tonight?

65
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because I booked in Canada for your birthday.

66
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
My home mother, she cooks every day.

67
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And in the beginning I always was a little afraid because of the stereotypes of English food.

68
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But that's really not true because I'm lucky.

69
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I expect that bad food's work but I have food.

70
00:09:33,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think it's that immersing themselves in English, you know, being in a British family that's

71
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
speaking English all the time.

72
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's completely different to learning it in a classroom and perhaps speaking with somebody else who is also learning it.

73
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You know, you're picking up that native language basically.

74
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
At school you learn grammar, because you're certainly a good teacher in the conference.

75
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So I'm, but then these things you have to practice and the family is the way you can practice language.

76
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You can learn when you get wrong, they can correct your mistakes and so on.

77
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes, I think if you stand a student dormitory, you're more likely to meet people of the same nationality and not practice.

78
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're English as well as it would if you were a homestay.

79
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
When you're a homestay, you have to speak English.

80
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
As a school I'm really learning the grammar vocabulary, the English language.

81
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But in my host family, I have the chance to speak with them and to practice the English accent.

82
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And I think by hearing them always speaking at the end of time that helps me a lot to see how to speak.

83
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And I think by hearing a lot, I learn also.

84
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Often their accent needs encouragement and help.

85
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
They encourage to listen a little bit so they can match our speech patterns for intonation.

86
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And this happens very much in the dining room over across the table.

87
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And the fact that my husband was a professor of linguistics he can always give the reasons sometimes I think the explanations are a little bit about the students, but they just are likely some must go in.

88
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It was a whole family, mom, dad and they had two kids.

89
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And I found it quite helpful that the children didn't speak such a complicated language and they had many tools to learn to write and read.

90
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Because they go to school here very early, the age of five, I believe.

91
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So always when I didn't know something, they would draw me a picture of it and try to explain me.

92
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So once you get the word this way, you will never forget it because you have the whole interaction and whole experience wrapped around it.

93
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes, so that was brilliant.

94
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I believe that it's doing these simple things with them, like to eat, to watch TV.

95
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You don't talk to my show, you don't need to use that too much language because you are just a beginner.

96
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But even though if you don't realise it, but it all has the fact that you sleep on it and next day you feel something got in.

97
00:13:33,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I would advise if you're looking for home stay, please tell the company the school.

98
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
As much information as possible, what you're looking for.

99
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So then the service, we have to place you into a house family.

100
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If you tell that you want internet, you're allergic to certain animals, we need to know as much information as possible.

101
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So to make your experience perfect.

102
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Try to interact with them and be part of the family.

103
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Sometimes you have to also think that you are not in your country anymore and you have to adapt to some situations.

104
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's not going to be the same for you as your home or back in your country.

105
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's not going to be almost everything is going to be different.

106
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So maybe you have to give a little bit about you and try to adapt to different situations and enjoy the time of course.

107
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Just not to be scared because the family know how to deal with you, how to make you comfortable and so on.

108
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There are two things which I would be the worst and you need to find a balance in between.

109
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The worst thing is to be too shy and the other thing is to be too arrogant.

110
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Nothing will get you anywhere.

111
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So you need to find the balance somewhere in between and find your confidence.

112
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And take the dictionary.

113
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Have it always in your pocket.

114
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Whatever you see, it's like trying to interact with the people.

115
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And live it.

116
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't bring your world with you here and don't continue living in your culture and everything.

117
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You need to open for it and then it all comes to you and you will find it easier and easier to learn the language.

118
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's going to be a great experience not only in terms of learning English but in learning about life.

119
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Because you will encounter many different views of life are many different styles amongst the student that you hadn't realized what exists before.

120
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So you don't only come to learn English, you come to learn about how people live in the Western world.

121
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You need to find the balance in your culture and everything.
