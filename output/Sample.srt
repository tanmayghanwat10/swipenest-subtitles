1
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:07,780
Cambridge is a peaceful city. The people here are just lovely, I think, or secure here.

2
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:25,430
It's a very calm and it's quite like it's lovely. It's very peaceful.

3
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:41,170
People from all over the world come here to learn English, also to do degrees.

4
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,170
There are a lot of English students because of Cambridge University.

5
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:57,239
There are also a lot of international students, so there is quite a good life for young people.

6
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:05,239
My name is Cristina, I'm from Belgium, and I'm 18 years old, so I just finished high school in June.

7
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:11,240
I was quite confused about what I wanted to study this year.

8
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,240
I decided to do one year program, which is the foundation program.

9
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,240
But also to improve my English because when I came here, it was not that good.

10
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,240
My name is Michaela Shbert, I'm from Czech Republic.

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:34,240
I spent here the year, affecting my English, and to be honest, figuring out what I want to do with my life.

12
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:44,240
Then I met my English boyfriend, decided to stay and do all the things I wanted to do here.

13
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,240
I started the university, I wanted to do what I want to do, so I'm sending a film and media here in Cambridge.

14
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,240
My name is Carolina Blay, and I'm from Venezuela.

15
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Basically I'm doing a foundation course, and it's the study here in the UK.

16
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:05,240
When my parents told me, I would like to go to a different country and learn English.

17
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:12,240
I said, yeah, why not? They told me, well, why don't you go to Canada or America?

18
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Because it's quite near to Venezuela and I say, I would like to go to England.

19
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Really? Yeah, I would like to go to Cambridge.

20
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,240
I don't know why, you know, it was like a feeling that I wanted to go there.

21
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Then when we were like to sign, if it was better to stay in a home stay or in a residence, I say, I think I would like to stay in a home stay.

22
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,240
So I'd go practice with my husband, my husband, my husband and my husband.

23
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,240
You know, meet a really real family and how they live and everything.

24
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,240
And I think I made the right choice.

25
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,240
My name is Sylvia, I come from Italy and we are in Cambridge now in I'm a home stay girl.

26
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:10,240
And here in this house is my first time, but I went to Cambridge twice a year ago for the same reason starting at school and home stay.

27
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:34,699
They give us everything for the accommodation, laundry, everything and the conversation that is most important part of our health.

28
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,699
Our health of this own state.

29
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,699
And it's very nice.

30
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,699
I mean, it's the right thing to do to learn language fully.

31
00:04:46,699 --> 00:05:15,910
Well, home stay is basically a language in coming to live with a British family.

32
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,910
Be integrated into the family and immerse themselves in English to help them learn.

33
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:28,910
The basic home stay booking would be on a half board basis, which is bed breakfast and evening meal.

34
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:37,910
And the student would expect, obviously, they're at their own room and less specified in which case they may share with a friend in a twin room basis.

35
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:45,910
But they would expect, obviously, a bed wardrobe, a desk, lighting, so much to work.

36
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,910
Other extras may be into the access.

37
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:59,910
They would have access to laundry facilities and cooking facilities if they are booking on a self-catering basis.

38
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,910
Well, in my home stay, I had, you know, I have, you know, with them every day at six.

39
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,910
And also with a different students at our house as well.

40
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,910
Every Thursday they wash my clothes and they clean my room.

41
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:23,910
And actually, because I've been in my home stay for a year and a half.

42
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,910
I play squash with my house mom every Sunday and we enjoy different activities together.

43
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,910
I've been in the birthday of the kids and everything else.

44
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,910
No, I'm really a member of the family.

45
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,910
One day is where you stay with an English family.

46
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:53,910
And when I send English family encompasses all different nationalities of become part of English life.

47
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:00,910
And then you usually spend the morning at school, at the afternoon free.

48
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,910
And then in the evening, there's always a meal ready for you.

49
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,910
We all sit at the table, talk about what you've done during the day.

50
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,910
Perhaps discuss different aspects of English life.

51
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:24,430
Hello.

52
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,430
I would like to take my eyes.

53
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,430
I don't know when our next available date.

54
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,430
Oh, okay. That's no problem.

55
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:39,149
Here's a list of the next available pilot states in Cambridge.

56
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:42,149
For example, I think the next one is April.

57
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:49,149
I knew actually people who came here before to do the same program as me.

58
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:53,149
And one of them told me about her home stay.

59
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:56,149
That was really good and she enjoyed a lot.

60
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:02,149
So she recommended to me and the best cool also recommended this.

61
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,149
Some good home stays.

62
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:10,149
And so I chose to go in the one I'm here now.

63
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:14,149
Because I knew how it would happen more or less.

64
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:19,149
And also because we had a kitchen for the students.

65
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:24,149
We had quite good things in this specific family.

66
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:30,149
Often I understand the students have known previous students who've been in our house.

67
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:34,149
And so they apparently, when they send an application in,

68
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,149
or first-mechanical garage at the Bell School, they say it does,

69
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,149
it's getting a room.

70
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:45,149
And then the Bell School, what phone me asked if I have a room for it,

71
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,149
giving the dates.

72
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:50,149
And it goes from there.

73
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,149
Yeah, then you said, can you do that one?

74
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,149
I'm going to eat home tonight.

75
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:59,149
Because I've booked in California for your birthday.

76
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,149
My home mother, she cooks every day.

77
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:08,149
And in the beginning I was a little afraid because of the stereotypes of English food.

78
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:13,149
But that's really not true, because I'm lucky.

79
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:19,149
I expect that bad food, but I have food.

80
00:09:19,149 --> 00:10:00,519
I think it's that immersing themselves in English.

81
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:06,519
Being in a British family, speaking English all the time.

82
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,519
It's completely different to learning in a classroom,

83
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,519
and perhaps speaking with somebody else who is also learning it.

84
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,519
You know, you're picking up that native language, basically.

85
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,519
At school, you learn grammar.

86
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,519
You make exercise of listening in comprehension, so on.

87
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,519
Then these things that you have to practice,

88
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,519
and the family is the way you can practice language.

89
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,519
You can learn when you get wrong.

90
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,519
They can correct your mistakes and so on.

91
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,519
Yes, I think if you stand a student dormitory,

92
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,519
you're more likely to meet people of the same nationality

93
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,519
and not practice your English as well as in what if you're a homestay.

94
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,519
When you're a homestay, you have to speak English.

95
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,519
As a school, I'm really learning the grammar vocabulary, the English language,

96
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,519
but in my host family, I have the chance to speak with them

97
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,519
and to practice the English accent.

98
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:28,519
And I think by hearing them always speaking at the end of time

99
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,519
that helps me a lot to see how to speak.

100
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,519
And I think by hearing a lot, I learn also.

101
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,519
Often, their accent needs encouragement and help.

102
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:48,519
They encourage to listen a little bit so they can match our speech patterns for intonation.

103
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,519
And this happens very much in the dining room.

104
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,519
I've across the table.

105
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,519
And the fact that my husband was a professor of linguistics.

106
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,519
He can always give the reasons sometimes, I think,

107
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,519
the explanations are a little bit about the students,

108
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,519
but it's a delightly, some must go in.

109
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,519
It was a whole family, mom, dad, and they had two kids.

110
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,519
And I found it quite helpful that the children didn't speak,

111
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,519
such a complicated language, and they had many tools to learn to write and read.

112
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,519
Because they go to school here very early, the age of five, I believe.

113
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:37,519
So, always when I didn't know something, they would draw me a picture of it and try to explain me.

114
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,519
So, once you get the word this way, you will never forget it

115
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:47,519
because you have the whole interaction and the whole experience wrapped around it.

116
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
Yes, so that was brilliant.

117
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,519
I believe that it's doing these simple things with them, like to eat, to watch TV.

118
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,519
You don't talk to me, so you don't need to use that too much language

119
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,519
because you are just a beginner, but even though if you don't realize it,

120
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,519
but it all has the fact that you sleep on it, and next day you feel something got in.

121
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:59,549
Advise, if you're looking for home today, please tell the company the school

122
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:04,549
as much information as possible, what you're looking for.

123
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:08,549
So then the service, we have to place you into a house family.

124
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:15,549
If you tell that you want internet, you're allergic to animals, we need to know as much information as possible.

125
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:19,549
So, to make your experience perfect.

126
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:24,549
Try to interact with them and be part of the family.

127
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:29,549
Sometimes you have to also think that you are not in your country anymore,

128
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:34,549
and you have to adapt to some situations.

129
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:40,549
It's not going to be the same for you as your home or back in your country.

130
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:45,549
It's not going to be almost everything is going to be different.

131
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:50,549
So maybe you have to give a little bit about you,

132
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:57,549
and try to adapt to different situations and enjoy the time of course.

133
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:06,549
Just not to be scared, because the family know how to deal with you,

134
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:11,549
how to make you comfortable and so on.

135
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:18,549
So there's no problem because they know how to make you to feel you at home.

136
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:26,549
There are two things which I would be the worst and you need to find a balance in between.

137
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:32,549
The worst thing is to be too shy and the other thing is to be too arrogant.

138
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:36,549
Nothing will get you anywhere.

139
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:40,549
So you need to find a balance somewhere in between and find your confidence.

140
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:42,549
And take the dictionary.

141
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:44,549
Have it always in your pocket.

142
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:48,549
Whatever you see it, you try to interact with the people.

143
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:52,549
And live it.

144
00:15:52,549 --> 00:16:02,549
Don't bring your world with you here and don't continue living in your culture and everything.

145
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:05,549
You need to open for it and then it all comes to you.

146
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:09,549
It will find it easier and easier to learn the language.

147
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:15,549
It's going to be a great experience, not only in terms of learning English,

148
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:23,549
but in learning about life, because you will encounter many different views of life

149
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:29,549
for many different styles amongst the student that you hadn't realized what exists before.

150
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:35,549
So you don't only come to learn English, you come to learn about how people live from the rest of the world.
