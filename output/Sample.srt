1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Himbrich is a peaceful city and the people here are just lovely. I think we're secure here.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Himbrich is very calm and is all I can. It's lovely, it's very peaceful.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Him from all over the world come here to learn English also to do degrees.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There are a lot of English students because of Cambridge University but also a lot of international students.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So there is quite a good life for young people.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My name is Cristina. I'm from Belgium and I'm 18 years old so I just finished high school in June.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was quite confused about what I wanted to study this year. So I decided to do one year program, which is the foundation program.

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But also to improve my English because when I came here it was not that good.

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My name is Michaela Shbert. I'm from Czech Republic. I spent here a year affecting my English and to be honest really figuring out what I want to do with my life.

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And then I met my English boyfriend, decided to really stay and do all the things I wanted to do here.

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I started the university, I wanted to do what I wanted to do. So I'm sending a film and media here in Cambridge.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
My name is Carolina Blay and I'm from Venezuela and basically I'm doing a foundation course and it's to study here in the UK.

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My parents told me I would like to go to a different country and learn English.

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I said, yeah, why not? They told me, why don't you go to Canada or America because it's quite near to Venezuela and I say, I would like to go to England.

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Really? Yeah, I would like to go to Cambridge and I don't know why it was like a feeling I wanted to go there.

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then when we were like to sign if it was better to stay in a home stay or in a residence, I say, I think I would like to stay in a home stay.

20
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So I go practice with my house mom and my house dad and meet a really real family and how they live and everything.

21
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think I made the right choice.

22
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My name is Sylvia and I'm from Italy and we are in Cambridge now in I'm a home stay girl.

23
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And here in this house is my first time but I went to Cambridge twice a year ago for the same reason starting at school and home stay.

24
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, it's my first time.

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And it's so cool.

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And it means now that they give us everything for the accommodation, laundry, everything and the conversation that is the most important part of our, of this own stay.

27
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And it's very nice.

28
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I mean it's the right thing to do to learn language for me.

29
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Well, home stay is basically a language in coming to live with a British family.

30
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Be integrated into the family and immerse themselves in English to help them learn.

31
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The basic home stay booking would be on a half board basis which is bed breakfast and evening meal.

32
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And the student would expect obviously their own room and less specified in which case they make share with a friend in a twin room basis.

33
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But they would expect obviously a bed wardrobe, a desk, lighting so much work.

34
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Other extras may be into the access by Wi-Fi.

35
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They would have access to laundry facilities and cooking facilities if they are booking on a self-catering basis.

36
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, in my home stay, I have dinner with them every day at six.

37
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And also with a different students that are in the house as well.

38
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And every Thursday they wash my clothes and they clean my room.

39
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And actually because I've been in my home stay for a year and a half.

40
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I play a squash with my house mom every Sunday and we enjoy different activities together.

41
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I've been in the birthday of the kids and everything.

42
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, I'm really a member of the family.

43
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, home stay is where you stay with an English family.

44
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And when I send English family encompasses all different nationalities of become part of English life.

45
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And then you usually spend the morning at school at the afternoon free.

46
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And then in the evening there's always a meal ready for you.

47
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And we all sit at the table, talk about what you've done during the day.

48
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Perhaps discuss different aspects of English life.

49
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Hello, I would like to dig my eyes.

50
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't know when are the next available these?

51
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, okay, that's no problem.

52
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Here's a list of the next available pilot states in Cambridge.

53
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
For example, I think the next one is April.

54
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I knew actually people who came here before to do the same program as me.

55
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And one of them told me about her home stay.

56
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That was really good and she enjoyed a lot.

57
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So she recommended to me and the best school also recommended us some good home stays.

58
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And so I chose to go in the one I'm here now because I knew how it would happen more or less.

59
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And also because we had a kitchen for the students.

60
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We had quite good things in this specific family.

61
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Often I understand the students have known previous students who've been in our house.

62
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And so they apparently when they send an application in or first met in a garage at the Bell School,

63
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
they say it does, this is going to have a room.

64
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then the Bell School would phone me and ask if I have a room for giving the dates.

65
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And it goes from there.

66
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
When you say can you tell the judge that you are not going to eat home tonight?

67
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because I booked in Canada for your birthday.

68
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
My home mother she cooks every day.

69
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And in the beginning I was a little afraid because of the stereotypes of English food.

70
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But that's really not true because I am lucky.

71
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I expect that bad food is what I have food for.

72
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you very much.

73
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I think it's that immersing themselves in English.

74
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Being in a British family, speaking English all the time.

75
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's completely different to learning it in a classroom and perhaps speaking with somebody else who is also learning it.

76
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And you know you're picking up that native language basically.

77
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
At school you learn grammar, make exercise of listening comprehension so on.

78
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But then these things you have to practice and the family is the way you can practice language.

79
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You can learn when you get wrong.

80
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They can correct your mistakes and so on.

81
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes, I think if you stand a student dormitory.

82
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're more likely to meet people of the same nationality and not practice your English as well as it would if you were a home-stay.

83
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
When you're in a home-stay you have to speak English.

84
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
As a school I'm really learning the grammar vocabulary, the English language.

85
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But in my host family I have the chance to speak with them and to practice the English accent.

86
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And I think by hearing them always speaking at the inner time that helps me a lot to see how to speak.

87
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I think by hearing a lot I learn also.

88
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Often their accent needs encouragement and help.

89
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
They encourage to listen a little bit so they can match our speech patterns for intonation.

90
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And this happens very much in the dining room over across the table.

91
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And the fact that my husband was a professor of linguistics he can always give the reasons.

92
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Sometimes I think the explanations are a little bit about the students, but it's a delightly, some must go in.

93
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It was a whole family, mom, dad, and they had two kids.

94
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And I found it quite helpful that the children didn't speak such a complicated language.

95
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And they had many tools to learn to write and read because they go to school here very early, the age of five, I believe.

96
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So always when I didn't know something they would draw me a picture of it and try to explain me.

97
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So once you get the word this way, you will never forget it because you have the whole interaction and whole experience wrapped around it.

98
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes, so that was brilliant.

99
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I believe that it's doing these simple things with them, like to eat, to watch TV.

100
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You don't talk to me, so you don't need to use that too much language because you are just a beginner.

101
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But even though if you don't realize it, but it all has the fact that you sleep on it, and next day you feel something got in.

102
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Thank you very much.

103
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Thank you.

104
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I would advise if you're looking for home stay, please tell the company the school as much information as possible what you're looking for.

105
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So then the service, we have to place you into a house family.

106
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If you tell that you want internet, you're allergic to certain animals, we need to know as much information as possible, so to make your experience perfect.

107
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Try to interact with them and be part of the family.

108
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Sometimes you have to also think that you are not in your country anymore, and you have to adapt to some situations.

109
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's not going to be the same for your home or your home or back in your country.

110
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's not going to be, you know, almost everything is going to be different.

111
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So maybe you have to give a little bit about you and try to adapt to different situations and enjoy the time of course.

112
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Just not to be scared because the family know how to deal with you, how to make you comfortable and so on.

113
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So there's no problem because they know how to to make you to feel you at home.

114
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There are two things which I would be the worst and you need to find a balance in between.

115
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The worst thing is to be too shy.

116
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And the other thing is to be too arrogant.

117
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Nothing will get you anywhere.

118
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So you need to find the balance somewhere in between and find your confidence.

119
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And take the dictionary if you have it always in your pocket.

120
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Whatever you see in front of you, try to interact with the people.

121
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And live it.

122
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't come here, don't bring your world with you here and don't continue living in your culture and everything.

123
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You need to open for it and then it all comes to you and it will find it easier and easier to learn the language.

124
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's going to be a great experience not only in terms of learning English but in learning about life.

125
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Because you will encounter many different views of life.

126
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Very many different styles amongst the student that you hadn't realized what exists before.

127
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So you don't only come to learn English.

128
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You come to learn about how people live in the rest of the world.

129
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Thank you very much.

130
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Thank you very much.
